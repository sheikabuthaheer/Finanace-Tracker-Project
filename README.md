# Finanace-Tracker-Project
The Finance Tracker is a personal finance management web/mobile application designed to help users monitor their income, expenses, and savings effectively. The project enables users to record daily transactions, categorize them (e.g., food, bills, travel, shopping), and visualize financial data through charts and reports.
